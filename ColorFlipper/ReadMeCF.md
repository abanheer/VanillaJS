This project is called Color Flipper. When you open the index.html, you will see the default background color : #f1f5f8. 
As you click the Click Me! button, the color of the backgrund flips and it also displays the name of the new background color. 
Here there are two options too, there is Simple and Hex. 
Simple refers to a specific set of colors while Hex refers to the infinite number of hex colors that can be generated to be the background color. 

The point of this project is to teach and understand how things can be changed randomly from 
a) a specific set an 
b) an infinitely made up library
